## Hi 👋 I'm Aymen Msaddak

🎓 Fourth-year **Information Technology** student at **Tunis Business School**,  
with a **double minor in Data Analytics and International Business Economics**.

I’m interested in **software development and analytical problem-solving**, particularly in building
systems that transform data, rules, or real-world constraints into practical and scalable solutions.
My work often sits at the intersection of **backend development, data analysis, and applied modeling**,
with a strong focus on clarity, structure, and decision support.

I enjoy tackling complex problems by combining **technical implementation** with **analytical reasoning**,
whether through software systems, data-driven insights, or exploratory machine learning approaches.
